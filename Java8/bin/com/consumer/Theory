Consumer :-

1)It accepts input and doesn't return anything
2)It has accept() method
3)It has andThen() method to call another consumer 
4)We can apply multiple andThen() method

interface Consumer<T t>{

void accept(T t){ }
}

BiConsumer :-

1)It takes 2 input and doesn't return anything.
2)It has accept() method
3)It has andThen() method to call another consumer 
4)We can apply multiple andThen() method
interface BiConsumer<T , U >{

void accept(T t, U t){ }
}
